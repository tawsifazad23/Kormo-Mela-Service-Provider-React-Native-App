# Kormo Mela - Empowering Service Providers and Customers in Bangladesh

## Inspiration
Kormo Mela was inspired by the significant challenges that individuals in Bangladesh face when trying to find reliable service providers such as drivers, housekeepers, and other essential workers. The process is often cumbersome, relying heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations and informal networks. This creates inefficiencies for both customers seeking help and service providers looking for work. Kormo Mela aims to bridge this gap by leveraging technology to create a streamlined, trustworthy, and user-friendly platform.

## What Kormo Mela Does
Kormo Mela is a networking platform designed to connect customers with verified service providers in Bangladesh. The platform consists of two interconnected mobile applications—one for customers and one for service providers (drivers, housekeepers, etc.). Through an easy-to-use, Tinder-style interface, users can quickly find and hire the right help for their needs, while service providers can find job opportunities tailored to their skills and availability.

## Key Features
- **User Verification**: All users are verified using their National ID, ensuring trust and security.
- **In-App Communication**: Seamless chat and voice call features allow customers and service providers to discuss job details before finalizing.
- **Payment & Job Confirmation**: Secure payment integration ensures that transactions are smooth and reliable.
- **Service History**: Users can view details of future and past services, helping them keep track of their engagements.

## How We Built It
Building Kormo Mela involved several critical steps, combining modern technologies with a deep understanding of user needs:

- **Frontend Development**: The mobile applications were developed using React Native for cross-platform compatibility, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Backend Development**: The backend was built with Django and Python, providing robust functionalities including role-based authentication, real-time communication, and secure payment processing.
- **Database Management**: We used PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable database management, ensuring data integrity and quick access.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging to send instant notifications, keeping users informed of new job postings, requests, and confirmations.
- **User Interface**: Leveraged React and Next.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface, enhanced with WebGL/3.js for a visually appealing design.
- **Version Control**: Managed the entire development lifecycle using Git, ensuring efficient collaboration and version control.

## Challenges
Throughout the development of Kormo Mela, we encountered several challenges:

- **User Verification**: Implementing a secure and efficient user verification process that leverages National IDs.
- **Seamless UX**: Balancing a feature-rich platform with an intuitive user experience required careful design and iterative testing.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the platform could handle a large number of users and transactions without compromising performance.

## Accomplishments
We are proud of several key accomplishments during the development of Kormo Mela:

- **Creating a Secure Platform**: Successfully implemented a user verification system that enhances trust and security.
- **Developing a Scalable MVP**: Built a fully functional MVP that is now in the funding stage, ready for scaling and wider adoption.
- **Founding a Startup**: As the founder, I led the entire process from ideation to MVP, and I'm currently leading efforts to secure funding and scale the platform.

## What We Learned
The journey of developing Kormo Mela has been filled with valuable lessons:

- **Importance of User Feedback**: Direct feedback from potential users has been crucial in shaping the platform to meet real needs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Building a robust architecture that can grow with the user base is essential for long-term success.
- **Role of Technology in Social Impact**: Technology can be a powerful tool for solving real-world problems and creating economic opportunities.

## What's Next for Kormo Mela
Looking ahead, our goals for Kormo Mela include:

- **Expanding User Base**: Roll out the app across major cities in Bangladesh and eventually expand to other regions.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Introduce additional services and features, such as home repairs, tutoring, and more, to broaden the platform's utility.
- **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Collaborate with local businesses, NGOs, and community organizations to further enhance the platform's reach and impact.
- **Securing Funding**: Actively seeking investors to support the scaling and growth of Kormo Mela, turning it into a leading platform for service providers in Bangladesh.

Kormo Mela is more than just an app—it's a mission to improve the lives of millions by connecting them with the services they need. Join us on this journey as we continue to innovate and expand!
